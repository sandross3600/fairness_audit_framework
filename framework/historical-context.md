# Historical Context Assessment

## Purpose

Understanding the **historical context** is essential for grounding fairness assessments in social, legal, and ethical realities. This step identifies structural inequalities, past discrimination, and domain-specific sensitivities that may influence fairness risks in an AI system.

## Key Goals

- Uncover relevant history of harm, bias, or exclusion.
- Identify impacted communities or demographic groups.
- Inform the selection of fairness definitions and metrics.
- Avoid fairness "blind spots" by learning from context-specific precedents.

## How to Use This Component

Use this guide before selecting fairness definitions or implementing metrics.

### 1. Define the System Domain

Determine the system type (e.g., lending, hiring, admissions, healthcare) and the decision it supports.

### 2. Research Relevant Historical Patterns

Use credible sources to explore:

- Discriminatory laws or practices
- Previous lawsuits or regulatory actions
- Research on disparities in outcomes
- Community and civil society perspectives

Include information on:

- Protected groups (e.g., race, gender, age)
- Specific features (e.g., credit score, test scores) with historical bias
- Geographical or institutional context

### 3. Document Key Findings

Capture findings in structured form:

| Historical Pattern | Source | Relevance to System |
|--------------------|--------|---------------------|
| Redlining in mortgages | U.S. Housing Act Reports | Relevant for credit-based lending models |
| Gender bias in hiring practices | EEOC litigation archive | Relevant for resume screening models |
| Algorithmic bias in recidivism scores | ProPublica, 2016 | Relevant for risk prediction tools |

## Output

This component produces a **Historical Context Summary** to be included in fairness documentation.

### Example Output (Loan Approval System)

- **Domain**: Consumer Lending
- **Finding**: Historical under-approval of loans for Black and Hispanic borrowers despite similar creditworthiness.
- **Source**: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reports, academic research.
- **Implication**: Group fairness metrics (e.g., statistical parity, equal opportunity) should be prioritized.

## Tips for Teams

- Collaborate with legal, compliance, and DEI experts.
- Use internal company archives, if available.
- Don't stop at the "obvious" groups — intersectional analysis may reveal deeper issues.
