# fairness_audit_framework

## Overview

The **Fairness Audit Framework** is a modular, actionable framework designed to help engineering teams assess and address fairness in AI systems. It integrates foundational fairness principles with practical tools, workflows, and guidelines to support systematic, scalable, and legally defensible fairness evaluations.

Developed in response to increasing concerns about bias in AI models, this playbook helps organizations move beyond ad hoc assessments by standardizing fairness audits across domains, models, and teams.

## Why it matters

AI systems influence critical decisions in finance, healthcare, hiring, and more. Without a consistent fairness audit process, organizations risk legal exposure, reputational harm, and systemic discrimination. This playbook aims to:

- Standardize fairness evaluation across teams
- Translate theory into practice using rigorous yet practical tools
- Foster accountability and transparency in AI development

## Core components

The framework includes the following five integrated components:

1. **Historical Context Assessment**  
   Understand historical inequities and their relevance to the system being audited.

2. **Fairness Definition Selection Tool**  
   Select appropriate fairness definitions based on context, stakeholders, and ethical priorities.

3. **Bias Source Identification Tool**  
   Identify where bias can enter in the data and model development lifecycle.

4. **Fairness Metrics Tool**  
   Select, implement, validate, and communicate fairness metrics based on definitions and system characteristics.

5. **Integration Workflow**  
   A guide on how these components interact in a real-world audit process.

## Features

- ðŸ”„ Reusable workflows across AI domains (e.g. finance, healthcare, HR).
- ðŸ“Š Metric selection, implementation guidance, and reporting templates.
- ðŸ§ª Statistical validation guidance with uncertainty quantification.
