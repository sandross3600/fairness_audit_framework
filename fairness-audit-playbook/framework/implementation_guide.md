# Fairness Audit Playbook – Implementation Guide

## Purpose

This guide helps engineering teams systematically assess, monitor, and improve fairness in AI systems using the Fairness Audit Playbook. It outlines how to apply the playbook’s four components and integrate fairness workflows into real-world development processes.

---

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 🔍 Step 1: Historical Context Assessment

**Objective**: Understand past harms, affected groups, and domain-specific risks.

**How to use**:
- Interview domain experts and stakeholders.
- Document historical patterns of harm.
- Use `historical_context_template.md`.

📎 _Output feeds into Fairness Definition Selection._

---

### 🎯 Step 2: Fairness Definition Selection

**Objective**: Choose fairness definitions that align with domain needs and stakeholder priorities.

**How to use**:
- Identify whether decision is merit-based, impact-based, or opportunity-based.
- Use the `definition_selection_tool.md` and decision flowchart.
- Choose 1 primary and 1–2 secondary fairness definitions.

📎 _Output defines what metrics to calculate in Step 4._

---

### 🧠 Step 3: Bias Source Identification

**Objective**: Pinpoint where bias may enter your ML pipeline.

**How to use**:
- Use `bias_source_checklist.md`.
- Audit:
  - Training data: representation, label quality.
  - Features: correlations with protected attributes.
  - Model: complexity, interpretability.
  - Outputs: disparate performance.

📎 _Output informs mitigation strategies + feature/model choices._

---

### 📏 Step 4: Fairness Metrics Selection & Evaluation

**Objective**: Quantify fairness using statistically validated metrics.

**How to use**:
- Use `fairness_metrics_tool.md` to match fairness definitions with metrics.
- Calculate metrics + confidence intervals.
- Use fairness dashboards and heatmaps.
- Apply intersectional and individual fairness where relevant.

📎 _Output supports remediation plans and reporting._

## Integration Tips

| Phase              | Action                                                 |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Problem Scoping   | Apply Steps 1–2                                        |
| Model Development | Apply Step 3                                           |
| Evaluation        | Apply Step 4                                           |
| Post-Deployment   | Monitor fairness over time, retrigger audit on drift  |

## Team Requirements

| Role            | Responsibility                                      |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| ML Engineer     | Implement metrics, retraining strategies           |
| Product Owner   | Coordinate audit steps and timelines               |
| Legal/Compliance| Validate fairness definitions against regulations  |
| Data Scientist  | Statistical validation, modeling decisions         |

---

## Practical Guidelines

- 🕒 **Time Needed**: 2–4 weeks for a full audit depending on complexity.
- 🧠 **Expertise Required**:
  - Moderate ML/statistics
  - Basic understanding of fairness principles
- 🧩 **Reuse**: Pre-filled templates, modular tools.
- 🔁 **Iterate**: Re-audit after major data/model updates.

---

## Key Decision Points

- **Which groups are protected**?
- **What kind of harm matters most** (opportunity loss, misclassification)?
- **Are your metrics statistically significant and robust**?
- **Have intersectional and individual fairness both been considered**?

---

## Output Checklist

✅ Historical context report  
✅ Fairness definitions with rationale  
✅ Bias source map  
✅ Metric results + confidence intervals  
✅ Intersectional analysis  
✅ Mitigation recommendations  
✅ Final summary for stakeholders

## Scaling Across Domains

| Domain      | Adaptations Required                            |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Healthcare  | Extra sensitivity to false negatives, HIPAA     |
| Finance     | Regulatory thresholds, ECOA constraints          |
| HR/Recruiting| Intersectionality key; audit resume features    |
| Education   | Label quality & opportunity-based fairness       |

---

## Maintenance and Continuous Monitoring

- Use dashboards for real-time fairness metrics.
- Trigger re-audits:
  - When model retrains on new data.
  - When performance drifts across subgroups.
  - When new protected attributes are introduced.

## Final Notes

This guide is designed for self-service by AI teams. For complex systems or novel domains, consult fairness experts for advanced evaluation, especially for causal or individual fairness analysis.
